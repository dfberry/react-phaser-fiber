If you are using react-dom, you can customize the `canvas` element that Phaser renders into.

If you are not using react-dom, you can setup a custom canvas by passing the DOM
reference in the [Phaser.Game config](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Game.html#canvas__anchor)

<Playground customCanvas>
  <Canvas style={{ border: '1px solid red' }}>
    <Game width={400} height={400} />
  </Canvas>
</Playground>

## Props

Same props as a regular `<canvas />`
