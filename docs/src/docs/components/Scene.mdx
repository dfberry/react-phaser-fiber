A Scene is required to render components into your game. Typically Scenes are used as levels, or stages, for your game, but
you can render more than one at a time if you wish.

Every Scene requires a `sceneKey` which should be a unique identifier. If you have textures or other assets that you need to preload,
you can load them in `onPreload`.

<Playground>
  <Game width={400} height={400}>
    <Scene
      sceneKey="main"
      onPreload={(scene) => {
        scene.load.image('mushroom', '/images/mushroom.png')
      }}
    >
      <Sprite x={200} y={200} texture="mushroom" />
    </Scene>
  </Game>
</Playground>
